Statement of Work:  

Our project is a social platform that allows users to share photos and post short videos, post comments, follow other creators, and connect with people worldwide. It offers a space for users to share moments from their daily lives and express themselves openly. Over the years, social media platforms have gained immense popularity across all age groups. Their rise has made global interactions much simpler. While platforms like Instagram are widely used, they are often criticized for limited editing features, excessive advertisements, and the growing difficulty for smaller creators to gain visibility. Our project aims to create a more advanced social media platform through innovative design and enhanced user-centric features. We will offer expanded editing tools, fewer ads, and increased support for smaller creators to help them grow and engage more effectively with their audience.
