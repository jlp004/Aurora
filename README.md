**Statement of Work:**  
Our project is a social platform that allows users to share photos and post short videos, post comments, follow other creators, and connect with people worldwide. It offers a space for users to share moments from their daily lives and express themselves openly. Over the years, social media platforms have gained immense popularity across all age groups. Their rise has made global interactions much simpler. While platforms like Instagram are widely used, they are often criticized for limited editing features, excessive advertisements, and the growing difficulty for smaller creators to gain visibility. Our project aims to create a more advanced social media platform through innovative design and enhanced user-centric features. We will offer expanded editing tools, fewer ads, and increased support for smaller creators to help them grow and engage more effectively with their audience.

## Instructions
To run the website, you must run **node server.js** and **npm run dev** in the project root. You can run these in parallel in any bash-compatible terminal by running the run.sh script by using **./run.sh** in your terminal of choice. Addtionally, you may also have to run **chmod +x run.sh** in terminal on the first run to give the bash script executable permissions.
If you are not using a bash-compatible terminal (i.e. Windows PowerShell), you will have to manually run **node server.js** and **npm run dev** in two separate terminals to achieve full compatibility. This can also be done in any bash terminal.
